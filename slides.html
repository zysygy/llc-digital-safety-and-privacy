        # Get to know each other

        For this workshop, we'll be working in groups. The exercises we'll be doing depend on how well you know each other.

        1. Break into groups of 4-5 people
        2. Find out more about each other. Take notes and make a profile for each person on a piece of paper.

          Here are some things you should try asking
            * Age
            * Places lived
            * Occupation
            * Schooling
            * Pets
            * Hobbies
            * Favourite books, movies, TV shows
            * Favourite food

          It's okay to decline answering a question, but more complete profiles are better.
        3. Save the profiles on the side for now. Label them with your initials. If people in the group share initials, add a number to distinguish them.

      Computers and the Internet play a huge role in our lives. They let us conveniently do work, keep in touch, and have fun.

      However, we should be aware of the digital dangers. Consider what could go wrong when:

      * **Banking online and transferring money**
      * **Sending emails and sharing files**
      * **Chatting and using social media**
      * **Installing smart devices in your home**

      Hackers are sometimes portrayed as hooded figures causing a bit of mischief. However, they are a threat that need to be taken seriously.

      While some hackers hack for the challenge or to cause mayhem, many treat the activity as their **job**.

      For these hackers, the ability to exploit and break into systems is tied their livelihood. Thus, they will use whatever resources available to achieve their goals.

      In some cases they are supported by well-funded criminal organizations or even nation states.

      # Security and Privacy VS Convenience

      We must accept that there are always **trade-offs between security and covenience**. The more secure we want to be, the more we'll have to work to keep ourselves safe.

      This workshop aims to explain both the risks and consequences of technology as well as the security measures we can take to protect ourselves.

      While it is generally encouraged to as secure as possible, it is up to you to decide what level of security you are comfortable with.

      #  Passwords

      How many passwords do you have?

      On average, a person has **40 accounts** registered with their primary email address. When making a password, conditions are usually enforced that complicate the process to try to make them more secure.

      With so many credentials to remember and cumbersome rules, people have developed bad habits and misconceptions of how to handle their passwords.

      What are some of the troubling trends that arise from poorly managed passwords?

      * Password Sharing
      * Password Exposure
      * Password Reuse
      * Weak and Complicated Passwords

      Some of these may seem obvious, but not everyone understands the consequences.

      #  Password Sharing

      Even if you think you can trust someone (can you really?), can you also trust them to never share it with someone else?

      Some cases of compromised accounts are due to people carelessly sharing their passwords.

      <!-- .element: class="centered-media" -->![Whisper](framework/img/workshop/whisper.jpg)

      It’s *impossible* for someone to accidentally (or purposefully) leak a password if they never know it. If you really must share a password, be prepared to accept the risk.

      With so many passwords to remember, people resort to writing down their passwords on a pad of paper or typing them into a text file on their computer.

      <!-- .element: class="centered-media" --> ![Notepad](framework/img/workshop/notepad.jpg)

      Passwords stored in these ways can be easily discovered or stolen, even if you think you can hide them well. The safest place for passwords is inside your head!

        Password strength evaluations should be treated only as a baseline assessment.

        In other words, the suggested strength or crack time is the maximum amount of time it would take to crack a password, **but it may take less time**. Hacking methods are sophisticated and constantly improving.

        If your password is listed as "weak" or only taking a few minutes/seconds to crack, you should highly consider making a change!

      #  Brute Force

      The idea behind this method is simple: Try all possible combinations of passwords and see if they grant access.

      * aaaaaaa
      * aaaaaab
      * aaaaaac
      * and so on...

      Many sites restrict the number of login attempts, but you can’t assume all of them do. Many hackers also use **offline attacks** which can bypass this safeguard.

      The full topic on password security involves measures such as **hashes** and **salting**, but for this workshop we'll stick with the basic ideas.

      A more sophisticated version of Brute Force is called a **Dictionary Attack.**

      Hackers don’t have to check every combination because people are not good at being random. Most people use common words, phrases, and other predictable terms for their passwords.

      Here’s a list of the top 5 most common passwords (exposed in data breaches)

      1. 123456

      * Names and places - **johnsmith**
      * Common words and phrases - **iloveyou**
      * Keyboard patterns - **qwerty**
      * Famous characters or places - **superman**

      * Append years or numbers to the end - **password1982**
      * Simple additions to fit password rules - **Password!1**
      * Common substitutions - **p@ssW0rD**

      #Exercise: Match the passwords (10 minutes)

      Let's find out how predictable our password are.

      **1.** Gather the profile and password sheets for each person in your group and scramble them.

      **2.** Trade your group's profiles and password sheets with another group.

      **3.** Discuss with your group to match the other group's passwords to the correct person's profile. Make your guess by writing the profile initials on the password sheet. Circle any common and weak passwords (eg. password, qwerty, 123456).

      **4.** Once you've made your guesses, return the profile sheets and passwords to the original group.

      # How Password Managers Work

      A person comes up with a strong Master Password to remember.

      The manager helps generate and store secure passwords in a Password Database.

      The person installs the password manager onto their devices. They unlock the database with the master password and the password manager automatically fills in the right credentials when signing in.

      One strategy for more secure passwords is to make a **passphrase** using a fun technique.

      **1. Brainstorm a list of items for each of the following categories. Try to come up with at least *five* ideas for each one**

        * A unit of measurement ("Gallon", "Bunch")
        * Adjective ("Muddy", "Boisterous")
        * Animal that you wouldn't find on a farm, plural ("Geckos", "Giant Squids")
        * Verb, past tense ("Ran", "Dropped")
        * Colour ("Mauve, Sky Blue")
        * Nationality or material ("Dutch, Suede")

      Instead of remembering **27 individual characters**, you're really just remembering **6 words** with some capitalization changes and inserted characters.

      The method also creates a silly story you can visualize for yourself in your mind (just imagine those tiny hippos).

      # Other Secure Password Strategies

      No password strategy is perfect. There will always be trade-offs between **security** and **convenience**.

      The passphrase method is recommended because it is simple to use and memorize, but still has vulnerabilities. Passphrases can also be long to type, especially on touch screens.

      Here are some other methods you may want to consider:

      ##Phonetic Passwords
      Passwords made up of phonetic sounds to create pronouncable, but fake words. You can use a generator to help you come up with ideas

      # Other Secure Password Strategies

      ##Acryonym Strategy

      Think of a song lyric, poem, religious verse, or nursery rhyme that you know well.

      >With glowing hearts, we see thee rise.

      >The True North, strong and free

      > From far and wide

      > O Canada

      > We stand on guard for thee

      Take the first letter of each word and then add some variations on the capitalizations, numbers, and symbols

      eg. Wg!HwstrTTNsAF15FFawocwsoG#ft7

      This method also creates memorable passwords, but be careful not to choose a phrase or subject that you use a lot publicly.

      # Changing Passwords

      Conventional knowledge suggests changing passwords occasionally so passwords don’t become “stale” and vulnerable to attacks. However in practice, frequent password changes encourages people to make weaker passwords.

      Most experts now suggest to only change a password *when you are notified of a security breach*, though some services may still impose occasional password changes because of outdated standards.

      Be wary of requests to change your password as these are sometimes **phishing** attempts.

      # Multi-Factor Authentication

      **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA or 2FA)** adds an additional layer of security on top of passwords.

      Normally, simply knowing the account name and password is all you need to sign into an account. With MFA enabled, you need **both the password and a code from an additional authenticator**.

      <!-- .element: class="centered-media" --> ![Multi-Factor Authentication](framework/img/workshop/multifactor.jpg)

      <!-- .element: class="centered-media" --> ![Multi-Factor Authentication - Text](framework/img/workshop/mfa_text.png)

      This method is popular as most people carry their phones with them at all times. However, there have been proven attacks against SMS authenticators, though using this option is still much better than using nothing!

If you are not sure if the sender is real, send an email to the original source by manually creating a new message rather than replying directly. You can also use another form of communication such as phone, text, or a chat service as it is less likely for a hacker to control multiple forms of communication.

      Have you heard something like this before?

      The companies received fines and made public apologies, but these gestures give little solace to the people who had their privacy violated.

      # How data lives on the Internet

      Once you put information out there, it is virtually impossible to remove.

      It is copied, transferred, and shared almost instantaneously and remains out there forever.

      **Doxxing** and **Social Engineering** hinge on the availability of information and makes password dictionary attacks and phishing attempts more effective.

      #Exercise: Doxxing

      How easily can someone find information about you? Let's use a search engine like Google to see what we can find

      1. Search for you name. Add quotes around your name for more precise results eg. “Harry Potter”

      2. Based on the results that match you, scan the pages for more information like interests, social media nicknames, and places of work. Add these search terms to your name.

        * “Harry Potter quidditch”
        * “Harry Potter Hogwarts”
        * “@hpotter”
        * “The Boy Who Lived”

      3. Repeat the process by adding any possible leads that come up

      # Doxxing

      How much did you manage to uncover? How long did it take? Did it seem easy to do?

      This information is all freely available to anyone who can access a search engine on the Internet. There are far more sophisticated methods available that can turn up even more information.

      Large social media companies like Facebook can even construct **shadow profiles** for people who don’t even use their platform.

      Data that other users upload is combined with publicly available information to infer details about non-users.

      # Is your data being protected?

      Even if you are ok with your data being bought and sold, you cannot be sure where else it could end up.

      Using a search engine, look up any financial institution, social media network, or service that you’ve signed up for and add the following terms:

      * data breach
      * data leak
      * security flaw
      * hacked

      Eg. “BMO data breach”, “WhatsApp hacked”, “Netflix security flaw”

      Once the data is out, there is no telling who can access it what can be done with it.

      #  Have you already been pwned?

      Data breaches regularly expose lists of passwords for websites and services.

      Check if your accounts registered to an email have been exposed in a data breach by visiting the following website

      https://haveibeenpwned.com/

      If you find that your account has been involved in a breach, it doesn't necessarily mean someone has broken into your account.

      Password databases are usually protected by additional security measures, but it’s never guaranteed. It's good practice to change your passwords if they're exposed in a breach.

      #Check the Terms of Service

      It can be daunting to go through a website’s terms of service and privacy policies, especially when they are long and full of legalese.

      Fortunately, **Terms of Service; Didn’t Read** is an online project that aims to summarize the policies of major websites in a more digestible format.

      Visit https://tosdr.org/ to have a look at some of your frequently used websites and services.

      # Reducing your digital footprint

      We don’t have to be afraid to use the Internet. However there are some precautions that can keep you safer.

      **Think twice before signing up**

      Carefully consider if you really need a service. What sort of information could they collect and what could they be using it for? Every different site is another potential place that can expose or sell your data.

      This point is especially important for children as they are vulnerable and may not understand the risks.

      **Tighten your share settings and permissions**

      Most websites and services give options to adjust what information you make public and what information is collected. Do a search for the service and “privacy settings” and you should find specific instructions.

      # Reducing your digital footprint

      **Think before you post**

      "Anything you say can and will be used against you"

      Always remember that once a post is made it is out there forever. Deleting posts after the fact doesn’t guarantee it is fully removed.

      **Delete old accounts you don’t use anymore**

      Getting rid of unused accounts can limit the amount of information someone can find and also reduces the chance of your information being exposed in a data breach.

      **Use alternate emails for different services**

      Using multiple email accounts for different groups of services can help spread your information profile around and make it more difficult to pinpoint information back to you after a data leak. A password manager is helpful in managing these accounts.

      Consider Switching Services
      Many popular services sell your data and/or don’t prioritize your privacy. You may want to try some different options

      # Other Tools and Advice

      Install an Ad Blocker in your browser
      Ads are not only annoying, but they also track your behaviour on websites.
      Try uBlock Origin and Adblock Plus (make sure to search for these exact terms as there are many fakes). Ad blockers also have the extra benefits of improving website speed and reducing data usage.

      Use Private Browsing or Incognito Mode
      Most browsers have a private or incognito mode, which reduces the amount of tracking that can be done. Private Browsing doesn’t prevent all tracking and if you’re signed into an account, your activity on that website can still be tracked.

      <script type="text/template">
      # Other Privacy Advice and Tools

      Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN)
      VPNs are tools that help keep your Internet activity secure and safe from tracking. They are especially helpful if you are using public WiFi networks that you are not sure are safe. However like with private browsing, a website can still track your activity if you sign in. Avoid using free VPNs as they often end up selling data to make up operation costs.

      Using these tools do not guarantee 100% safety, but they can greatly improve your online privacy. Always do your research and read reviews before choosing a tool.

      # Wrapping Up

      It may seem like the Internet is a scary place with hackers trying to steal your information and companies outright buying and selling it.

      However, we must remember that this technology has had an immensely positive impact on our lives.

      Cars cause accidents and create pollution, but that doesn’t mean we should be afraid of driving.

      Just remember to check your mirrors, buckle up, and enjoy the ride.
