      For these hackers, the ability to exploit and break into systems is tied their livelihood. Thus, they will use whatever resources available to achieve their goals.

      # Security and Privacy VS Convenience

      We must accept that there are always **trade-offs between security and covenience**. The more secure we want to be, the more we'll have to work to keep ourselves safe.

      This workshop aims to explain both the risks and consequences of technology as well as the security measures we can take to protect ourselves.

      A little effort can go a long way, but it is up to you to decide what level of security you are comfortable with.

      You want to create an account for the latest social media craze: **your**Space

      On a small sheet of paper, write down a password you might use to sign up for a **your**Space account.

      You have some password rules. You might have seem rules like these elsewhere
      > * Your password has to be at least 6 characters long
      > * Must contain at least one lower case letter
      > * one upper case letter
      > * one digit
      > * one symbol ~!@#$%^&*()_+
      > * It must not be a password you've used somewhere else

      Many cases of compromised accounts are due to people carelessly sharing their passwords.

      # Password Cracking

      What makes a password easy to guess? How do hackers even do the guessing?

      Let’s learn about the actual methods hackers use to figure out passwords and determine what could make it more difficult for them.

      Password cracking and security is a fasincating and complex topic deserving its own workshop.

      We'll be focusing only on the basic ideas in these slides, but additional resources will be linked for those interested in learning more.

      # Method 1: Brute Force

      The idea behind this method is simple: Try all possible combinations of passwords and see if they grant access.

      * aaaaaaa
      * aaaaaab
      * aaaaaac
      * and so on...

      A lot of password security boils down to *delaying the inevitable*. A brute force attack can eventually check every password combination.

      To understand our chances against brute force, we need to know the number of possible password combinations and speed that computers can guess passwords.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
      # Brute Force: Combinations

      Recall the rules from before:

      > * Your password has to be at least 6 characters long
      > * Must contain at least one lower case letter
      > * one upper case letter
      > * one digit
      > * one symbol ~!@#$%^&*()_+

      How many possible combinations could exist with these rules?

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
      # Brute Force: Combinations

      There are 52 upper and lower case letters, 10 digits, and 13 symbols meaning each character has a total of **75** options.

      Thus the password format looks like this
      ```
          (75) (75) (75) (75) (75) (75)
      ```

      ```
      eg. ($)  (3)  (c)  (R)  (e)  (t)
      ```

      In total, there are **75<sup>6</sup> (or about 178 billion)** total password combinations with these rules.

      That's a lot of combinations to guess!

      <!-- .element: style="max-width:40%;float:right;margin-left:5px;margin-top:-2%;padding:2px" -->![Typing Cat](framework/img/workshop/typing_cat.gif)

      A person could probably try a dozen combinations in a minute and maybe several thousand in a day.

      Computers are way faster at performing repetitive tasks than humans are, making them perfect for brute forcing passwords.

      Let's do an analysis to see just how quick they are.

      <!-- .element: style="clear:both" -->The rate at which computers guess passwords depends on two main factors:

      * **Computing power of the device**
      * **How the password is processed<sup>1</sup>**

      ###Further Reading

      * <sup>1</sup>Passwords are rarely guessed directly as they are often stored as **cryptographic hashes** with **salting**. The type of hash is a big factor in cracking time.

      ###Notes
      * <!-- .element: class="delayed"-->This example serves as a representation of computing power. A real PS4 would need to be heavily modified by an expert to crack passwords.
      * <!-- .element: class="delayed"-->While using a game console for our analysis might seem silly, there's actually a history of using PlayStations for supercomputing! [Example 1](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/ps3-folding-question.htm), [Example 2](https://phys.org/news/2010-12-air-playstation-3s-supercomputer.html)
      </script>
      <!--Hello curious reader!

        I assume you're asking how we derived this 2 billion guesses/second number

        We get some benchmarks for modern hardware on cracking software here: https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/hashcat-benchmarks-nvidia-gtx-1080ti-gtx-1070-hashcat-benchmarks/

        1 1080 Ti can calculate approx 11.3B h/s.
        1 1070 can calculate approx 6B h/s

        That's right, modern hardware can calculate 11.3 billion hashes per second!

        These map to approx 10.6 and 5.8 tflops respectively. tflops are a measure of raw computing power https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_10_series

        The relationship between raw performance in tflops to billions of hashes calculated per second is about 1.047x

        We find the PS4 can operate at 1.84 tflops https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/playstation-4-gpu.c2085

        Thus with the PS4's raw computing power computing power, you could calculate around 1.92B h/s

        We round this to a clean 2B h/s for ease of calculation and presentation

        In reality it would quite a bit slower due inefficiencies in adapting PS4 hardware to password cracking but this is more of an illustrative exercise than a practice one.-->

      When it comes to protecting yourself brute force, the most important tip is to **make passwords longer.**

      But is this enough? <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

      # Dictionary Attack

      A more sophisticated version of Brute Force is called a **Dictionary Attack.**

      Hackers don’t have to check every combination because people are not good at being random. Most people use common words, phrases, and other predictable terms for their passwords.

      Here’s a list of the top 5 most common passwords (exposed in data breaches)

      1. 123456
      2. 123456789
      3. qwerty

      # Composing a Dictionary

      Hackers generate a **dictionary** of likely password candidates by analyzing trends in existing data breaches. They use this dictionary to run their password guessing attempts.

      Some common elements and patterns found in data breaches include:

      * Names - **johnsmith**
      * Keyboard patterns - **qwerty**
      * Website names - **myfacebookpassword**
      * Common words and phrases - **iloveyou**
      * Famous characters or places - **superman**

      # Composing a Dictionary

      Simply adding symbols and numbers often doesn't add much difficulty for cracking since people are predictable in how they add them to their passwords.

      Here are some common ways people make variations on **"password"**:

      * Trivial additions to fit password rules - **Password!1** (10 chars long)
      * Adding years to the beginning or end - **password1982** (12 chars long)
      * Common substitutions, word additions - **NetflixP@ssW0rD** (15 chars long)

      These extra variations can be easily programmed by the hacker into their password cracking software.

      Remember, these variations can be guessed at a rate of **2 billion/second** with only $400 worth of computing power!

      ###Notes
      * It's hard to say exactly how much faster a dictionary attack is compared to brute force. It depends on the predictability of the password and hackers are constantly improving their methods.
      * Since Dictionary attacks are so much more effective, plain brute force is used more of a fallback option.

      3. The person installs the password manager onto their devices. Each device will be able to access database.

      4. The Password database is unlocked with the master password.

      5. The password manager automatically fills in the right credentials when signing in to a website.

      # Exercise 5: Creating a Passphrase (15 minutes)

      # Passphrase Memorization

      The passphrase may still seem like a difficult to remember password.

      However, the structure of the password allows you to break the password into chunks to memorize.

      Instead of remembering **27 individual characters**, you're really just remembering **6 words** with some capitalization changes and inserted characters.

      The method also creates a silly story you can visualize for yourself in your mind (just imagine those tiny hippos).

      It's important to practice a few times once you make your passphrase. After a couple times, you should be able to memorize it without a problem. You'll be using it regularly so it's unlikely you'll forget it.

      # Multi-Factor Authentication

      **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA or 2FA)** adds an additional layer of security on top of passwords.

      <!-- .element: style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:5px" -->![Multi-Factor Authentication](framework/img/workshop/multifactor.jpg)

      Normally, simply knowing the account name and password is all you need to sign into an account. With MFA enabled, you need **both the password and a code from an additional authenticator**.

      A hacker would need to somehow discover your password and access to your authenticator to gain access to your account.

      <!-- .element: style="clear:both" -->Every site has different ways of enabling MFA so check their instructions for setting it up.

      # MFA Options

      Services and websites support different forms of authenticators, each varying in convenience and security. One of the most common methods is to provide a phone number that can be sent an authentication code.

      <!-- .element: class="centered-media" --> ![Multi-Factor Authentication - Text](framework/img/workshop/mfa_text.png)

      This method is popular as most people carry their phones with them at all times. However, there have been proven attacks against SMS authenticators<sup>1</sup>, though using this option is still much better than using nothing!

      # Recovery/Security Questions

      Recovery questions are especially vulnerable to **doxxing**. A hacker do some research to find the information you use for your recovery questions such as:

      * Childhood friends
      * Mother's Maiden name
      * Hobbies and interests
      * Past Vacations

      Some websites still require recovery questions. The recommendation is to use unrelated, but memorable terms. You may also use a password manager to keep a secure note of the terms being used for recovery.

      The information and behaviour patterns found in doxxing is used to enhance the phishing scam. They will reference actual events, use real people’s names, and imitate behaviours to increase the feeling of authenticity.

      Spear Phishing usually targets important people in organization that control finances or sensitive information.

      * Clicking on a link

      ##URL or sender email looks wrong or suspect. Watch out for subtle differences

      * eg. yourespace.com, amazonn.com, facebook.secure.ca
      * If you didn't type in a site address manually, be extra careful!

      ##Vague greetings, spelling mistakes, and poor grammar

      * Scams often come from parts of the world where English is not the first language
      * Interestingly enough, there are several reasons why some phishing attempts purposefully include spelling and grammar mistakes

      These are just hints. An email or website that lacks these criteria is not necessarily safe. Be skeptical before taking any actions. Better safe than sorry!

      1. Search for you name. Add quotes around your name for more precise results **eg. “Harry Potter”**

      2. Based on the results that match you, scan the pages for more information like interests, social media nicknames, and places of work. Add these search terms to your name.

        * **“Harry Potter quidditch”**
        * **“Harry Potter Hogwarts”**

      Anyone who can access a search engine on the Internet can also access this information. There are sophisticated methods and tools available that can turn up even more details.

      Large social media companies like Facebook have even constructed **shadow profiles** for people who don’t even use their platform. Data that other users upload is combined with publicly available information to infer details about non-users.

      # Reducing your digital footprint

      We don’t have to be afraid to use the Internet. However there are some precautions that can keep you safer.

      ##Think twice before signing up##

      * Carefully consider if you really need a service. What sort of information could they collect and what could they be using it for? Every site is another potential place that can expose or sell your data.

      ##Tighten your share settings and permissions

      * Most websites and services give options to adjust what information you make public and what information is collected. These options are usually found in the Settings, Preferences, or Profile of the app
      * If you are unsure, search for the service name and “privacy settings” on a search engine

      # Reducing your digital footprint

      ##Think before you post

      * "Anything you say can and will be used against you"
      * Be aware of who can view your public posts or photos. Deleting content after the fact doesn’t guarantee it is fully removed (though it can help).

      ##Delete old accounts you don’t use anymore

      * Getting rid of unused accounts reduces the number of places your information could be searched or exposed

      ##Use alternate emails for different services

      * Using multiple email accounts for different groups of services can make it more difficult to pinpoint information back to you after a data leak. A password manager is helpful in managing these accounts.

      # Other Tools and Advice

      ##Install an Ad Blocker in your browser
      * Ads are not only annoying, but they also track your behaviour on websites.
      * Try uBlock Origin and Adblock Plus (search for these exact terms as there are many fakes). Ad blockers also have the extra benefits of improving website speed and reducing data usage.

      ##Use Private Browsing or Incognito Mode
      * Most browsers have a private or incognito mode, which reduces the amount of tracking that can be done. Private Browsing doesn’t prevent all tracking and if you’re signed into an account, your activity on that website can still be monitored.

      # Other Privacy Advice and Tools

      ##Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN)
      * VPNs are tools that help keep your Internet activity secure and safe from tracking
      * They are especially helpful if you are using public WiFi networks that you are not sure are safe
      * Like with private browsing, a website can still track your activity if you sign in
      * Avoid using free VPNs as they often end up selling data to make up operation costs.

      Always do your research and read reviews before choosing a tool or service.

      Nothing can guarantee 100% safety, but taking some of these steps can greatly improve your online privacy.

      # Wrapping Up

      It may seem like the Internet is a scary place with hackers trying to steal your information and companies outright buying and selling it.

      However, we must remember that this technology has had an immensely positive impact on our lives.

      Cars cause accidents and create pollution, but that doesn’t mean we should be afraid of driving. Cars have given us a freedom of movement we didn't have before.

      Just remember to check your mirrors, buckle up, and enjoy the ride.
